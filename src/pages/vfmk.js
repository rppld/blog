      <Paragraph>
        During the time I&rsquo;ve been working as a freelance developer I got
        to build the new website for the Austrian contemporary art book
        publisher <em>Verlag f√ºr moderne Kunst</em> in Vienna. View the live
        site in your browser:

      <Paragraph>
        The store-section of the site should be able to handle three different
        types of products: Artbooks, limited art prints, as well as random
        physical goods such as bags, coffee mugs, or calendars. We started this
        project using <em>WordPress</em> as a CMS{" "}
        <span role="img" aria-label="Neutral face emoji">
          üòê
        </span>, which was a client preference at the time. The{" "}
        <em>WooCommerce</em> extension should handle all e-commerce
        functionality{" "}
        <span role="img" aria-label="Neutral face emoji">
          üò©
        </span>. The site also needed to be multi-language, so we went ahead and
        installed the <em>WPML</em> plugin, which ultimately turned the site
        into <strong>one. Slow. Mess!</strong>{" "}

        been touching any WordPress code.

        Craft CMS to the rescue
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        At this point I had already some experience with this relatively new
        system called <em>Craft CMS</em> and they had just launched their own,
        first-party e-commerce plugin called <em>Craft Commerce</em>. I could
        convince the client to scrape together some more money and basically
        re-wrote the whole website for the new ecosystem, which turned out to be
        the right decision for both, my brain to not turn into jelly, and also
        for the client and content editors, because they immediately fell in
        love with Craft.

        as a notable example for Craft Commerce websites which meant a lot and
        made me extra proud!
