      <Paragraph>
        During my tenure at Bolden one of my bigger projects was the site of
        Amsterdam-based footwear label <em>Filling Pieces</em>. They started out
        selling their products online using <em>OpenCart</em> as a platform, and
        even though OpenCart is a very capable tool, it kinda couldn&rsquo;t
        keep up with the pace the company was growing, which was especially true
        during the peak of an ongoing sale.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        In order to ensure smoother sale-ing (Get it? SALE-ing!), we went
        through the process of porting everything over to <em>Shopify</em>.
        Shopify comes with its own limitations, but once you learn how to
        embrace them instead of finding workarounds you&rsquo;ll end up a happy
        camper. The huge plus of Shopify imho is that it&rsquo;s amazingly
        stable and really easy to manage.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Unfortunately the design of the site didn&rsquo;t undergo a similar
        evolution and remained basically untouched. As a personal challenge â€“
        and to satisfy my inner designer{" "}
        <span role="img" aria-label="Satisfied face emoji">
          ðŸ˜Œ
        </span>{" "}
        â€“ I translated some ideas into a concept of how I would build a classic,
        yet adaptable design.

        A re-designed approach
      </Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Filling Pieces releases new products twice a year with every release
        having a new theme requiring a few small adjustments in various places
        (&ldquo;Guys, for the drop of spring-summer 2017, is it possible we add
        an extra section that contains a product image with clickable hot-spots
        and have the menu-drawer in dark-blue?&rdquo;). With the current site
        not really designed to be themeable, this usually meant a lot of
        fiddling and patchwork.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The concept I've been working on is based on a themeable frontpage plus
        one interchangeable accent colour for the whole website. This way, the
        first impression of a visitor can be completely different with every
        release in whatever design the new theme requires, with the rest of the
        site basically remaining unaffected. This could convey the sense of
        something <em>new</em> twice a year, while keeping the same familiar
        shopping experience from the product overview to the checkout.
      </Paragraph>
